# Signals and Systems - Self-Study

This repository contains my self-study notes, lecture summaries, and practice problem solutions as I work through UC Berkeleyâ€™s EE 120 course (*Signals and Systems*) and the textbook *Signals and Systems* by Alan S. Willsky, Ramamurthy Mani, and Syed Hamid Nawab.

## Overview

### Goals
- **Course Lectures**: Follow along with the lecture material for EE 120, UC Berkeley's undergraduate course on signals and systems.
- **Textbook Practice**: Work through practice problems from the *Signals and Systems* textbook to reinforce lecture topics and build a deep understanding of the subject.

## Structure

The repository is organized by **lectures** and **textbook chapters**, each with its own folder containing notes and problem solutions.
